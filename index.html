    <p>Current interests?  Programming of course!  I have also always had a passion for music, whether it be playing or listening.  A great stress reliever for me, currently, is playing the piano.  Not necessarily in front of others, but privately on a keyboard with headphones connected.  Growing up, I was always a member of orchestras or chamber groups as a cellist.  I always loved it.  Solo performing was a challenge, but being part of these groups always made me strive to exceed my limitations.  Some of my best relationships and experiences were produced through playing music.  As a teenager, I was able to perform wedding ceremonies with chamber groups, and travel to both Australia and Germany with orchestras.  Another passion of mine has been sports.  I've never really played competitively, only for fun.  However, the only television I watch will be basketball and football, and sports news is always my first web browse each morning.</p>
