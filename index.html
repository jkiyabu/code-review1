          <p>Current interests?  <em><strong>Programming of course!</strong></em>  I have also always had a passion for music, whether it be playing, listening, or even producing.  A great stress reliever for me, currently, is playing the piano.  Not necessarily in front of others, but privately on a keyboard with a set of headphones attached.  Growing up, I was always a member of an orchestra and chamber group as a cellist.  I always loved it.  Solo performing was a challenge, but being part of these groups always made me strive to exceed my limitations.  Some of my best relationships and experiences were produced through playing music.  As a teenager, I was able to perform wedding ceremonies with chamber groups, and travel to both Australia and Germany with the Portland Youth Philharmonic and PSU orchestra.  Another passion of mine has always been sports.  I've never played competitively, only streetball with friends and family as a youth.  However, if I do have time to watch television, its usually a basketball or football game.  Sports news is also my first web browse every morning.</p>
